### Hi there 👋

I'm Martin, a front-end developer based in Cape Town, South Africa. 

I've been a developer for over a decade and mostly focus on front-end web developement.

I'm also a web development educator, course developer and content creator. I'm in the process of creating my own NPO, BuiltByWomen.org, which focuses on upskilling women on real-world projects. Let me know if you're interested or want to help.

About me: I love the ocean 🌊 and marine life 🐟, it's all really fascinating to me. ☺
